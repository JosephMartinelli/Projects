# Projects
These are all the exam's projects I've done during my accademia. The most recent ones are from the Master's degree at UNIFI in Data Science, while the oldest ones are from my bsc at UNISA.
To access each project's repository, you can click on the title of each header. Most of the projects description are in italian, Since the courses were taught in italian

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/VAEs'>Computational Learning: An implementation from scratch of VAEs</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>Pythorch,Pandas, Pythorch Autograd</p>
The following project has been one of the most interesting and challenging work I have ever done. I do believe I have learned a lot on how torch and the autograd engine really work in the field of ML,

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/APMD2022'>Alghorithms and Programming for Massive Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>Pandas,Networkx</p>
The scope of the project was to apply all the theorical concepts regarding the dealing and the traversing of large quantity of data. A lot of care has been put not only in prepocessing phase, but also the creation of a complex data structure.

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/WebMiningProject'>Web Mining: Group Project</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>Pythorch,Pandas, Pythorch Autograd</p>
Thanks to the course of Web Mining, I have acquired knwoledge about the use of statistical models for the representation and modelling of graph-based data. The project aim was to develop a statistical model able to capture,represent and learn the relations of the penguins of the acquarium of Tokyo

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/DataMining-Organization'>Data Mining and Organization: Data Mining Project</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>Pandas&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
The course of Data Mining and Organization had the objective of learning how to find latent information from a high volume data source and to how deal with the organization of it. In particular, the former part of the course thought how to find pattern in information, while the latter thought why the use of traditional data structures is not ideal while dealing with data sources that can not be loaded fully into memory due to their size.

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/Multivariate-GroupProject'>Multivariate Analysis: Group Project</a></h1>
Description coming soon...

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/ConditionalTrees'>Multivariate Analysis: Individual Project</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>None</p>
The main objective of the project was to propose a deep dive in the theoretical aspects of using conditional inference in the construction of decisional binary trees

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/DSP-Assignments'>Data Security and Privacy: Assignments</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>None</p>
Here you can find all the assignments I did for the course of Data Security and Privacy. The assignment are all Python implementations of encryption algorithms we did during the course

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/MARS-FIA'>MARS-FIA</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Python&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>Pandas</p>
This is a clustering based recommendation system we built for the exam of Artificial Intelligence at UNISA

<h1><a href='https://github.com/JosephMartinelli/ArtGalleryProject'>Art Gallery Project</a></h1>
<p><b>Language:&nbsp;</b>Java for back-end&nbsp;, HTML and CSS for front end&nbsp;<b>Libraries learned:&nbsp;</b>None</p>

A web-app that emulates an art e-commerce. Completely built in java for the back-end while html and css are used for the front. Also, here you can see we used Selenium and Boostrap
